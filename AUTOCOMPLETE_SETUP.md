# Autocomplete Setup Guide üöÄ

## New Features Added

### ‚úÖ **City Autocomplete**

- Real-time city suggestions as you type
- Debounced API calls (300ms delay) to prevent excessive requests
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API
- Smart suggestion prioritization

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Search Experience**

- Type 2+ characters to see suggestions
- Tap any suggestion to instantly get weather data
- Loading indicators during suggestion fetching
- Error handling for failed requests

## How It Works

1. **User types** in the search bar (minimum 2 characters)
2. **Debouncing** waits 300ms after user stops typing
3. **API call** to OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API
4. **Suggestions display** in a dropdown list
5. **User selects** a suggestion or continues typing
6. **Weather data** is fetched using coordinates (more accurate)

## API Endpoints Used

- **Geocoding API**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct`
- **Weather API**: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`

## Key Components

### `CitySuggestionList`

- Displays autocomplete suggestions
- Handles loading and error states
- Styled dropdown with proper positioning

### `useDebounce` Hook

- Prevents excessive API calls
- 300ms delay after user stops typing
- Improves performance and reduces API usage

### `geocodingService`

- Fetches city suggestions from OpenWeatherMap
- Formats display names (City, State, Country)
- Handles API errors gracefully

## Usage Example

```typescript
<SearchBar
  value={searchQuery}
  onChangeText={setSearchQuery}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
  onSuggestionSelect={handleSuggestionSelect}
  showSuggestions={true}
  placeholder="Enter city name"
/>
```

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced API calls** through debouncing
- **Faster user experience** with instant suggestions
- **More accurate results** using coordinates instead of city names
- **Better error handling** with specific error messages

## Testing the Feature

1. Start typing a city name (e.g., "Lon")
2. Wait for suggestions to appear
3. Tap on a suggestion
4. Weather data loads instantly
5. Try different cities to test the autocomplete

The autocomplete feature is now fully integrated and ready to use! üå§Ô∏è
